            The battle of guys Mike reluctantly calls his best friends, with one in particular absolutely shitting his pants. The
            Berds of War, YAC Sparrows, Berd gang, or whatever bird pun you call them came out of a draft where the manager said ‚ÄúI
            hate my entire team‚Äù no more than 27 minutes after drafting the All- Handcuff team of 2020. On the flip side the team
            formerly known as the Beef Whistles came out of the draft absolutely in LOVE with his squad --but that may have been the
            Molly hitting real hard right around that big bid for Todd Gurley.
          </p>
          <p>
            Week 1 kicked off with TJ somehow still riding a Molly high a week later and Sean waiting for the week 1 waivers with
            all that FAAB burning a hole in his pocket. The results were a decent showing for Sean‚Äôs team with 116.4 points - it is
            just too bad none of them will be on his roster by week 5. But decent was more than enough to beat the bag out of a team
            led by Joe ‚ÄúDon't let him get hot!‚Äù Mixon (he didn't) and Phillip ‚ÄúOld Man‚Äù Rivers. Despite this loss TJ still thinks
            his team is one to reckoned with - * as long as everyone has a career day.

            A skirmish began in the Sleeper chat...and it elevated to a full blown war in week 1. For the bloodthirsty MikeyRiot it
            was the long game. With Saquon, Noah ‚Äúsay my name in the top 5‚Äù Fant, and Courtland Sutton lined up on Monday night it
            was always going to be a comeback...and like General Patton at the Battle of the Bulge MikeyRiot switched out the
            injured/inactive Sutton for gym rat/slot receiver/Pats prototype white guy Adam Humphries and found his way to victory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matty‚Äôs squad put up a heck of a fight but like Rommel in North Africa he eventually succumbed to the RB heavy Golden
            Tate Warriors (Golden Tate is timeless). MikeyRiot blew his load in the draft on Josh Jacobs and Saquon Barkley and it
            paid off in week 1 (Barkley sucked but Jacobs was dynamite - 33.9 pts). Noah Fant showed his namesake Noah for your
            Weinert what a real TE looks like by doing all his damage in the first half but still outperforming Hunter Henry. A
            vintage Matty Ice 4th quarter garbage time performance added another 23.9 pts to the total and helped put the boys over
            the top.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matty, the TE whisperer, got solid performances across the board from Tom Terrific (you know MikeyRiot was torn on that
            one), Dalvin Cook (2 TDs), the corpse of David Johnson (18.4), Muscle Metcalf (17.5), and Travis Kelce (14) but his
            decision to leave TE #2 Dallas Goedert on the bench cost him in this one. Fitting that Dallas Goedert ended up being the
            difference...I guess you could say that‚Äôs Dallas.
          </p>
          <p>
            MikeyRiot continues his reign of terror by turning his attention from the eastern front and onto the Pacific Theater in
            the form of the rancid Beef Whistles. Matty gets a chance to show Zander who‚Äôs the #1 Devils fan in the fantasy football
            league and get his record up to 3-1.

            Noah‚Äôs big pick in the draft may have been solely based on the pun potential, but The Fresh Prince of Helaire delivered
            for 19.8 points in a Kareem Hunt-esque debut for the Chiefs (Let;s hope he doesn't end up on the Browns one day). But
            rookies are risky, especially with no pre-season, so Noah hedged his puns and was Theilen Good after a 28 point
            performance from his binky for the last few years, Adam.
          </p>
          <p>
            GAM on the other hand went all in on CMC, Julio, and Hopkins, then for some reason took Jared Goff before a lot of other
            QB‚Äôs. GAM rounded out his starting roster with the #5 option on the Chief‚Äôs offense in Mecole Hardman, Marlon Mack who
            is now on the IR, and Henry Ruggs who also tweaked a hammy a bit, to go along with his keeper in George Kittle, who, you
            guessed it, hurt his knee in week 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately for GAM, we only have 1 IR spot and Noah‚Äôs Punderdome Squad made easy work of them with a 135.8 - 94.3 victory.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that GAM also took Molly during the draft. That is a combined 0-6 in week 1 for The Molly Gang. Don't do drugs.

            What could go wrong when you have half the Bills roster in your starting lineup? Well, you lose by nearly 40 points. Jab
            reaped the benefits of trading Tyler Boyd and Lev Bell (Combined 10.9 points) to Matt for Calvin Ridley (29.4) and
            Phillip Lindsay ( it doesn't matter how many points he got).
          </p>
          <p>
            In an act of mercy, Jab left Josh Allen on his bench so Max could root for one of his two favorite teams in week 1 with
            no conflict of interest - other than those two teams being the division rivals fighting for the AFC East. But believe it
            or not, even with Josh Allen‚Äôs 28.18 points on his bench, Derrick Henry (14.6), Kenyan Drake (13.5), and even Boston
            Scott (6.4) outperformed a killer trio of Big Truss Mark Ingram (2.9), Devin Singletary (7.8), and Sony Michel (9.7).
          </p>
          <p>
            Max will look to right the ship this week as he hopes to tread water until Ryquell Armstead comes back from his second trip to the Covid Reserve List

            Another divisional showdown - this time from current tri-state area residents as well as proud Boyz n the Burbs. After
            the draft there were murmurs of a possible Toby worthy squad, keep his name out ya mouth, but week 1 showed that Toby
            will have to wait. Zander, upgraded Marek, brought the heat by letting Russ cook (31.78 pts, hot damn) and having the
            guy that waiver wire fodder Aaron Rodgers likes to use as his personal football blankie (Davante Adams went for
            34.6...again hot damn). Generally when you get 66.38 pts from TWO positions you win (hell, that total would‚Äôve almost
            taken down Mags by itself)...BUT NOT WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE PLAYING THE JUGGERNAUT FROM KATONAH!
          </p>
          <p>
            Zander put up 129.68 points, good for 4th highest and would‚Äôve actually been even higher but James Conner remembered
            that he was due for a mid game injury and went out in the 2nd quarter, and STILL GOT BLOWN OUT BY 17.06! The
            Mahouse/Mahomes boys were an absolute wagon, putting up a calm, cool 146.74. Suck on that big meat/beef whistles/meat
            nickname of the week. Johnny‚Äôs plucky upstart bunch got big performances from Mahomes (obvii, 20.44 pts), Zeke (feed me,
            26.2), Super Kamario (21.2), Robby. Anderson. (22.5), Sammy Watkins (week 1 darling, 18), TJ Hockenson (14.1), and even
            Allen Lazard put up 16.2 pts. Watch out world, the hurricane is coming for you. In week 2 Hurricane Mahouse will be
            looking to show dominance over fellow NY native Lucas and send him to a 1-3 start. Lord help us all. Zander gets to show
            Matty what Deez Nuts are all about and exert his will over gritty division rival and only other Devils fan left.

            Week 1 brought us the inaugural matchup of heavyweights in the Island of Misfit Toys division as well as a rematch of
            last season's CMC & LJax vs the World Championship bout. Oh my how things have changed. This pillow fight, 95.8 to 77.3
            final tally, between NY and NJ (now Indiana and Pennsylvania but roots run deep) ended up going the way of NY. Mags
            bought himself an impressive trio of WRs in Michael Thomas, Tyreek Hill and Chris Godwin but all he was left with was
            27.2 points combined, a high ankle sprain and a sore neck. Nick Chubb finds himself in a timeshare with a member of the
            berd squad though odds are in his favor of scoring a TD or two against the fightin‚Äô Joe Burrows in week 2.

            Lucas has LJax and that means an automatic 27.5 pts. Put it on the board. LJax put up 35.6% of TeamEMags21 total
            yesterday. You tend to win when that happens. Even though he went with the lounging cat mascot the rest of his squad
            still managed to bring enough good JuJu (21.9 pts and an adorable TD celebration with the pylon cam) to take this barn
            slow burner. Smart play by Lucas starting a stud WR against his, and Mags, beloved Giants. It‚Äôs a win-win baby!
          </p>
          <p>
            Mags takes on Jab in week 2 and unfortunately his team will prob show up and run train on those yellow bellied losers
            known as the Kenyan Cornelihursts. Lucas heads east for a matchup with fellow NY native and current juggernaut
            J.W.Hales.
